This repository consists of the majority of my physics research project to determine the effects of Earth's ionosphere on radio signals. The Newton's method solver takes pseudorange measurements 
from three or more satellites and calculates a satellite receiver's position. This calculation is then compared to the receiver's actual location to determine the offset in the distance
induced from the ionosphere as well as time differences between the receiver and the satellites. The major theoretical components of the script are based off of the very informative notes (the least squares file)
written by my supervisor, Professor Jonathan Sievers. Any code I pulled from elsewhere has their location detailed within the scripts themselves, unless otherwise written by me or my Supervisor.
